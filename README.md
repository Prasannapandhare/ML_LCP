# **Liver Cirrhosis Prediction**
* **Dataset : Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)**

### **Data Points required:**
* **Age:** Patient's age.
* **Gender:** Patient's gender.
* **Total Bilirubin:** The total amount of bilirubin in the blood, a yellow pigment produced by the breakdown of red blood cells.
* **Direct Bilirubin:** The direct fraction of bilirubin, specifically associated with liver function.
* **Total Proteins:** The total amount of proteins in the blood, including albumin and globulins.
* **Albumin:** A protein synthesized by the liver, crucial for maintaining blood volume and pressure.
* **A/G Ratio:** The ratio of albumin to globulins, providing insights into liver and kidney function.
* **SGPT (Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase):** An enzyme indicating liver health; elevated levels may suggest liver damage.
* **SGOT (Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase):** Another liver enzyme reflecting liver function; elevated levels may indicate liver problems.
* **Alkphos (Alkaline Phosphatase):** An enzyme associated with the biliary system; elevated levels may indicate liver or bone issues.
